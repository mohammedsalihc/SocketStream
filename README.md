SocketStream – Node.js Real-Time Messaging Backend
Backend for SocketStream, a real-time chat application built for seamless communication.

SocketStream is a messaging platform where users can register, log in (via email or Google), and engage in real-time conversations. The backend is production-ready and built for scalability, maintainability, and performance. It features full user authentication, protected APIs, profile management, and real-time messaging using WebSockets (Socket.IO).

While currently an MVP, SocketStream lays a strong foundation for team collaboration and communication. Its modular architecture supports clean scaling, and it's ready to integrate with both web and mobile frontends.

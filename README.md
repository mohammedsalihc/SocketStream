#SocketStream - Real-Time Chat Backend
SocketStream is a real-time messaging platform where users can engage in instant chat, view profiles, and collaborate efficiently. It includes secure user authentication using email and Google OAuth, protected routes with JWT, and live chat functionality powered by Socket.IO. MongoDB is used for data persistence, and the system supports profile management and basic moderation tools like block/delete.

This project is designed and developed with a focus on clean architecture and scalability. While not using a microservice pattern or containerization, the codebase follows modular principles, making it easy to maintain and extend. It serves as a solid foundation for real-world production-ready backend systems that require authentication and real-time communication features.

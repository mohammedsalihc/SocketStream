# SocketStream - Real-Time Chat Backend

SocketStream is a real-time messaging platform where users can engage in instant chat, view profiles, and collaborate seamlessly. The application includes user authentication via email and Google OAuth, real-time communication using Socket.IO, and secure session handling through JWT. It also features a simple yet effective user interface for managing conversations and users.

This project is developed with performance and scalability in mind. While not fully microservice-based, it separates concerns cleanly and uses WebSockets for real-time interactions. Built with Express and MongoDB, the backend is containerized with Docker and designed to be easily deployable to modern cloud platforms. It lays a solid foundation for future scaling with microservices, background jobs, and real-time infrastructure.
